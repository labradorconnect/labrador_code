  <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
  <h3>According to Gartner</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>75% of marketers stated projects are often behind or end up over budget because of technology challenges and communications bottlenecks</li>
    <li>Data analysts are at a premium in the field, but over half of marketing leaders said that their company's most expensive, experienced data analysts and scientists spend most of their time preparing data to be analyzed and not analyzing it</li>
    <li>Marketing teams are spending too much time onboarding, training, and managing their programs, in large part due to the overwhelming number of disparate programs that do not interface well</li>
  </ul>

<div id="problem-bg">
  <p>"There are so many solutions out there. Managing it all requires a substantial time investment. I want a partner who can lay out a roadmap for me. We have 57 vendors just in marketing technology. And you need a data scientist who has the keys to unlock what youâ€™re sitting on."</p>
